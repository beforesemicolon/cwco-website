<h2 id="what-is-cwco"><a href="#what-is-cwco"></a> What is CWCO?</h2>
<p><strong><abbr title="Contextful Web Component">CWCO</abbr></strong> stands for <em>Contextful Web Component</em>
and it is pronounced <em>CUOCO</em>.</p>

<p>It is a library that simplifies how you build Web Components with a powerful and
simple API which under the hood uses the browsers native web components APIs.</p>

<p>This means that:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Requires no build</b> and works where Web Components are supported;</li>
	<li>It is <b>lightweight</b> since its dependencies are shipped with browsers;</li>
	<li>It is <b>built on Web Standards</b> and mimics native HTML DOM behavior and best practices;</li>
	<li>It is just an <b>abstraction layer</b> over the complex Web Component APIs;</li>
	<li>It is <b>Object-Oriented</b> like Components and DOM Elements;</li>
	<li>It is <b>providing additional features and capabilities</b> to create HTML tags;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-you-mean-contextful"><a href="#what-you-mean-contextful"></a> What you mean Contextful?</h3>
<p><strong>CWCO</strong> is built on this idea that DOM elements are just data that you manipulate to build web views.
This data is stateful and changes with actions and events manually set by the developer.</p>

<p>
	For this reason every DOM element is
	associated with a <em>metadata</em> and a <em>context state data</em> which makes it possible for many features
	you will discover as you go through these documents.
</p>

<p>Because the DOM is organized in a Tree data structure, a parent data can be inherited by its descendants which is how
data changes propagate down. Data can also flow up unlike many libraries out there. CWCO does not re-invent the DOM, it
just works with it.</p>

<p>
	The DOM is pretty free and you can traverse it up and down as you like to do whatever you
	want. CWCO will not prevent you from doing anything. It will just provide you with tool to do those things easily.
</p>

<p>This makes it so it does DOM updates really fast.</p>

<h3 id="why-cwco"><a href="#why-cwco"></a> Why CWCO?</h3>
<p>CWCO is unique in its design. It is built to simplify how you build Web Components in order to promote this technology
as the future way to build the web.</p>
<p>The wonders of CWCO become evident when you start using and here are some reasons why you should:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Low learning curve:</strong> CWCO is just HTML, CSS and Javascript. It requires no additional knowledge to
	start since it is built on Web Standards.</li>
	<li><strong>No build required:</strong> In a world of bundles and builds CWCO is a plug and play library with
	amazing features you won't believe it is shipped in a very small package.</li>
	<li><strong>Use along with other libraries and framework:</strong> Because it is a plug and play library you can
  include it with any project like <b><i>React, Angular, Vue and Svelte</i></b>.</li>
	<li><strong>Build project-independent components:</strong> Components built with CWCO will work with any project. This
	is important to avoid having to convert a component library before using it. We believe in creating project independent
	component libraries.</li>
	<li><strong>Truly Reactive:</strong> CWCO components don't update the DOM only when you set a property.
	It will react to deep Array, Object Literal, Set, Map data changes which allows you to manipulate data normally.
	No additional syntax needed</li>
	<li><strong>HTML & CSS data binding:</strong> CWCO allows you to change a particular part of your HTML and CSS
	when data changes with one-way data binding.</li>
	<li><strong>Build directly in HTML:</strong> CWCO templates are the most advanced templates out there which
	allows you to build your view directly in HTML. No need to build everything on Javascript to then attach in
	the HTML page at runtime.</li>
	<li><strong>Built-in context data handling:</strong> The most amazing feature of CWCO is the context data which allows you to
	set up data at the top level component which any component inside can access. The is great for store data, global data,
	theming, localization, user data, etc. Its application is limitless.</li>
	<li><strong>Fast rendering:</strong> CWCO updates are fast and only target elements which needs to be updated.
	This is true even for long lists and complex component nesting.</li>
	<li><strong>Automatic state management: </strong> CWCO knows what to update when data changes. You don't have to
	manage state. Simply set and update data and let CWCO handle the DOM for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Powerful Directives:</strong> CWCO comes with few directives and the ability to create your own. CWCO
  directives are like HTML global attributes and allows you to override native attributes implementations like
		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/draggable">draggable</a> and <a
			href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable">contenteditable</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are so much more reasons to try that we can't wait to show you more.</p>

<p>You can see CWCO in action by following <a href="https://beforesemicolon.github.io/cwco/?example=create-component.html&theme=neo&file=app.js">these usage examples</a> or you can go ahead
and go through the <a href="/documentation/getting-started">getting started guide</a>.</p>
